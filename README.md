# TheOKNintendo
The OK Nintendo, which is almost as good as a Super Nintendo, is my physics electronics project. It features 2 game proof of concepts, Pokemon Ho (after Colgate University's Ho Science Center) and Super Segall Bros (after Professor Segall) which showcase the potential games that could be played, and Pac-Man, which is fully playable with 1 ghost AI, winning and ending conditions.  It's programmed on a Teensy 3.2 Arduino using a TFT Display and some other electronic parts.
